The evaluation findings are consistent with lumbar radiculopathy, characterized by chronic low back pain with radiating symptoms, likely due to nerve root irritation and degenerative lumbar spine changes. Pt received education on movement strategies to minimize neural provocation, pain management techniques, activity modification, and instruction in a tailored home exercise program. Functional impairments are primarily related to nerve-related pain, limited trunk mobility, and guarded movement patterns, all of which restrict performance of ADLs. Given the patient's motivation and active participation, the prognosis is favorable. Skilled OT is indicated to reduce radicular symptoms, restore pain-free mobility, improve functional capacity, and facilitate return to prior level of function.",

Pt will report 50% improvement in activity tolerance and fewer radicular symptoms with ADLs.\n\nLong-Term Goals (13–25 visits):\n1. Pt will demonstrate B LE strength of 4/5 to perform ADLs without triggering symptoms.\n2. Pt will complete 14 reps on 30-second sit-to-stand test without increased pain.\n3. Pt will tolerate 30 minutes of activity (e.g., standing, walking, chores) without symptom flare-up.\n4. Pt will independently follow a directional-preference HEP with proper posture and mechanics.",
